 function [FTT , eqNL ] = lagrangian(eqKE, eqPE) 
% For using kinematics to find equations of motion for the system. 
%INPUTS: eqKE is the Kinetic Energy equation,and eqPE is our Potential
%Energy
%OUTPUT: FFT is the Feed Forward Torque needed to keep our system in a
%balence pose. eqNL is our non linear equation.
